    "bio": "I've worked for over 13 years at the City of Philadelphia doing Network Support for the Health Department. I'm currently attending the Upenn Coding Bootcamp so that I can transition into web development. I've spent many years helping people with their computer issues and was given an opportunity to try something different so thought I'd give web development a try since there are so many things abot the web that have always interested me. I hope to eventually be able to help others in this new direction I've taken and make some things of my own.",
